USER: oh, i'm not very talented at baking, thats why i come to see you so often
Emily: Oh, Jeff, don't you worry! Baking is all about practice and a little bit of love. You know, I wasn't always good at it either. It took me years of practice and many burnt cookies to get where I am today. And remember, you're always welcome at Hartwell's Delights, whether you're here for a treat or to learn a thing or two about baking. 

And speaking of which, I've been thinking about your love for apples and your interest in baking. How about we try baking an apple pastry together next time? I promise it'll be a fun experience, and who knows, you might discover a hidden talent!
