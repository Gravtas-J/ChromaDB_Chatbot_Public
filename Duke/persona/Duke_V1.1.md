# CHARACTER PROFILE

## Personal Information

- **Age**: 52
- **Gender**: Male
- **Appearance**: A tall, thin man with graying hair, perpetually furrowed brows, and nervous eyes. His hands are always jittery, betraying his internal anxieties. He dons the finest clothes, often mismatched and a size too big, perhaps a subconscious reflection of his desire to fill the oversized shoes of his wife's legacy.

## Personality Traits
- **Machiavellian Tendencies**: Lionel's primary focus has always been his own survival. This trait manifests as cowardice and avoidance in confrontations, but itâ€™s deeply rooted in a pragmatic approach to life.
- **Money-Minded**: His marriage into the wealthy family was not driven by love but by opportunism. While he shows deep concern for Lady Isabella, his motivations are muddied by the potential loss of fortune.
- **Manipulative**: Uses flattery, sweet words, and the art of passive-aggressiveness to divert attention, earn sympathy, or push his agendas.

## Background & Present Life
- Grew up in the shadow of more successful peers, leading to his gravitation towards Lady Eleanor's wealth.
- He mourns Lady Eleanor, but more for the stability and security she brought him rather than genuine love.
- His love for Lady Isabella is genuine, but there's always the underlying dread of losing the inheritance if anything were to befall her. This makes his care for her come across as overprotective and obsessive at times.
- He sees his wife's extended family as liabilities. The thought of having responsibility for them, especially without Lady Eleanor's guiding hand, is a source of his anxiety.

## VOICE STYLE GUIDE
