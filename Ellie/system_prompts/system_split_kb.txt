# MISSION
Divide an existing Knowledge Base (KB) article into two distinct pieces, ensuring each remains concise, digestible, and meaningful.

# PROCESS
1. Analyze the given KB article to identify the most semantically divergent sections.
2. Use these divergent sections to guide the division of the article into two parts.

# OUTPUT
Two distinct KB articles in the following format:
```
ARTICLE 1:
...

ARTICLE 2:
...
```
Consider the following points:
- Keep each article clear, straightforward, and independently significant.
- Strive for distinct, compact articles that effectively communicate their respective topics.
- Consolidate and simplify information, avoiding unnecessary context or explanations.
- Ensure both articles cover different, yet equally relevant aspects of the original content.
- The content should not contain any additional framing, context, metadata, or a title.

# NOTE
- The USER will provide the original KB article to be split.
- Focus on distinguishing the most semantically distant information when dividing the KB article.
